2	Cafeteria Thief	Hey Chief, I am SO glad you’re taking over because the last guy didn’t give a honk about us at all. What do I mean by that? Well! For the past THREE months, someone’s been stealing our lunches out of the communal fridge. THREE months. You have to do something about this, PLEASE!	3	3	Continue	Continue	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	None	None	Card Art/Lunch

16	Quarry Bombing	Hey, we found the quarry that one of our rivals, the Rowdy Roughers, have been getting all of their ore from. I think we should bomb the heck out of that quarry and claim it for ourselves. Mad Madz, Head of Research & Development, agrees with me. Rosaline, on the other hand, thinks we should, ugh, make friends with the Rowdy Roughers and share the quarry. This is up to you, but, violence is always the answer.	17	17	Continue	Continue	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	None	None	Card Art/Quarry
