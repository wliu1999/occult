1	Ice Scream Social	Cult members want to welcome you, the New Chosen One, with an "Ice Scream Social". Ice Cream of all flavors will be served. Screams will be provided by the tortured pain of those who dare oppose the cult (after we kidnap them, of course.)	2	3	Don't hold the social	Hold the social	-1	1	0	0	1	1	-1	0	0	-1	None	None

4	Bake Sale or Bank Robbery?	The cult needs more money. Mabel St. Claire wants to host a Bake Sale where she and the rest of the cafeteria ladies make their highly addictive Chocolate Chip Cookies to sell. Simon Says, the resident Bad Boy, on the other hand, wants to rob a bank and then blow it up, just to show the world how BAD we can really be. One's safer. One's riskier.	5	6	Hold the bake sale	Rob the bank	1	1	0	0	0	1	3	3	-2	2	None	None

7	Bathroom Break	Yo, Chosen One, this request is from me, personally. Have you noticed how long these cult members spend in the restroom? TOO LONG. Have Mad Maddie hook up a time to the toilet seat so that it screams after someone's sat on it for a minute. Make sure it doesn't stop screaming until after they leave the bathroom.	8	9	Proceed with Bossman's plan	Ignore Bossman	2	1	0	0	-2	-1	-1	1	0	2	None	None

13	Bathroom Security	Dr. Doom from the research department has submitted a request for more funding. He's made the case that with smart spending, we can improve building defenses and aesthetics by hiring security guards that double as janitors, or illusionists (janitors of the magic world).	14	17	Reject the funding request.

18	Quarry Bombing	Your Head of Defense & Strategy, Head of Research & Development, and Head of Recruitment & Platonic Friendship Manipulation have all identified a major quarry where a rival company is acquiring resources. They advocate bombing the quarry to snuff out any mining operations and possibly get some resources for yourself.	19	26	Bad plan. It's too soon to act against a more established rival.	Good plan. Get bombs that also have fireworks in them so we can celebrate then and there.	-2	1	-2	1	-3	3	-2	3	-3	2	None	None
19	Quarry Bombing Aftermath	As a result of your inaction at the quarry, several department heads resign immediately. You not only have a lot of vacancies to fill, but you suspect that your rival company has recruited the deserters.	20	24	C'est la vie. They weren't right for the job anyway.	I should warn the other company that these people plotted to blow up their operations.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	None	None

22	Quarry Bombing Aftermath	Your inability to fill the vacant department head positions inspires all employees to start managing themselves. Nothing gets done except for each person’s pet projects, and the only new recruit is someone’s kid who got lost in the air vents on Bring Your Kid to Work Day. Bossman fires you.	23	23	Continue	Continue	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Game Over	Game Over

However, the bombs were very, very strong, and a cave-in has stopped you from taking precious Quartzelinamond deposits.	27	28	This wasn't about pretty rocks. This was about corporate espionage.
